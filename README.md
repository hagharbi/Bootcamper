# BOOTCAMPER
A centralized hub to help current bootcamp students connect with bootcamp graduates, instructors, and professionals to share issues, ideas and experiences.


## Motivation
As bootcamp students, we are overloaded with information on the web regarding all the new technology and programming languages that we are learning.

For example, stack overflow has a plethora of information, but it can be overwhelming to filter out useful information, especially when just starting out.

It would be nice to have a forum where bootcamp students can ask specific questions and receive answers that are understandable to beginners.
